# LPai Report System Documentation
**Date: June 9, 2025**

## Overview
The LPai Report System generates and sends automated performance reports via email using enhanced report generators that provide comprehensive analytics and insights.

## Architecture

### Active Components

#### Report Generators
- **EnhancedDailyReportGenerator** (`/src/utils/reports/enhancedDailyReport.ts`) - 1141 lines
  - Generates comprehensive daily analytics reports
  - Calculates system health scores
  - Provides actionable insights and recommendations
  
- **EnhancedWeeklyReportGenerator** (`/src/utils/reports/enhancedWeeklyReport.ts`) - 943 lines
  - Week-over-week comparisons
  - Financial impact analysis
  - Location growth tracking
  - Performance trends

#### Email Service
- **EmailService** (`/src/utils/email/emailService.ts`)
  - Wrapper for Resend API
  - Sends HTML reports to configured recipients
  - Uses `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable

#### Analytics Engine  
- **WebhookAnalytics** (`/src/utils/analytics/webhookAnalytics.ts`)
  - Records webhook processing metrics
  - Tracks SLA compliance
  - Calculates performance statistics
  - **NOTE**: Now fully integrated with webhook processors

### Cron Jobs

#### Daily Report (`/pages/api/cron/daily-report.ts`)
- **Schedule**: Daily at 9 AM UTC (defined in vercel.json)
- **Process**:
  1. Creates EnhancedDailyReportGenerator instance
  2. Calls generateDailyReport()
  3. Sends to info@leadprospecting.ai

#### Weekly Report (`/pages/api/cron/weekly-report.ts`)
- **Schedule**: Mondays at 9 AM UTC (defined in vercel.json)
- **Process**:
  1. Creates EnhancedWeeklyReportGenerator instance
  2. Calls generateWeeklyReport()
  3. Sends to info@leadprospecting.ai

### Deprecated Files (Safe to Delete)
- `/src/utils/reports/dailyReport.ts` - Replaced by enhanced version
- `/src/utils/reports/weeklyReport.ts` - Replaced by enhanced version

- processor_logs: Cron execution history
Weekly Report Metrics
javascript// From enhancedWeeklyReport.ts
- Week-over-week webhook volume
- Success rate trends
- Location growth (installs/uninstalls)
- Installation performance
- Financial impact estimates

Email Templates
HTML Structure
Both reports use rich HTML with:

Inline CSS for email client compatibility
Responsive design
Chart.js visualizations (for web view)
Color-coded metrics (green/yellow/red)
Animated elements (shimmer effects)

Styling
css- Primary color: #667eea â†’ #764ba2 (gradient)
- Success: #22c55e
- Warning: #f59e0b  
- Error: #ef4444
- Font: System font stack
Configuration
Email Recipients
Currently hardcoded to: info@leadprospecting.ai
To change recipients, modify:
javascript// In both report generators
const recipients = ['info@leadprospecting.ai'];
Report Timing
Configured in /vercel.json:
json{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-report",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"  // 9 AM UTC daily
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/weekly-report", 
      "schedule": "0 9 * * 1"  // 9 AM UTC Mondays
    }
  ]
}
Monitoring
Check Report Generation
javascript// MongoDB query to see recent reports
db.reports.find({ type: { $in: ['daily', 'weekly'] } })
  .sort({ generatedAt: -1 })
  .limit(10)
Verify Email Delivery

Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
Monitor email inbox for reports

Troubleshooting
Reports Not Sending

Check cron job execution in Vercel logs
Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
Check MongoDB connection
Review error logs in processor_logs collection

Missing Data in Reports

Verify webhook_metrics collection has data
Check if analytics integration is working
Ensure processors are running successfully

Performance Issues

Check report generation time in logs
Consider optimizing aggregation queries
Monitor MongoDB performance

Future Improvements

Configurable recipients via database
Custom report schedules per location
PDF export option
Interactive web dashboard
Real-time alerts for critical issues
