üéØ Master Action Plan for Backend Analysis
üìù Instructions for Each New Chat:
When you start a new chat for each system, use this template:
I'm analyzing the [SYSTEM NAME] in my LPai backend. Here are all the related files:

[Share the specific files listed below for that system]

Please analyze how these files work together and provide:
1. A flow diagram showing how the system works
2. Which files are deprecated/old vs current/new
3. Dependencies between files
4. Recommendations on what to keep/remove
5. Any bugs or issues you find
6. Documentation for how this system should work

Context: We recently restructured the backend and suspect some files are deprecated. The new pattern uses [describe the new pattern if known].

üöÄ Suggested Order:

Webhook System - Most complex, highest impact
Report System - Quick win, clear deprecation
Installation System - Has broken endpoint
Sync System - Core functionality
Auth System - Critical for everything
Analytics System - Newer addition
Cleanup - Quick deletions

üìä After Each System Analysis:
Create a summary document with:

System diagram/flow
Files to keep
Files to delete
Code to move
Bugs to fix
Documentation created

Then compile all summaries into a master architecture document.
Ready to start with the Webhook System? Just copy the template above and share those webhook files in a new chat!

Please analyze every file thuroughly. If you need more that i forgot let me know. We need to know how these files work together and provide:
1. A flow diagram showing how the system works
2. Which files are deprecated/old vs current/new
3. Dependencies between files
4. Recommendations on what to keep/remove
5. Any bugs or issues you find
6. Documentation for how this system should work

Context: We recently restructured the backend and suspect some files are deprecated. The new pattern uses [describe the new pattern if known].

üìã Summary of Webhook System Cleanup
‚úÖ What We Accomplished:

Removed 5 Deprecated Files:

webhookProcessor.ts - Old monolithic processor
unified.ts - Old endpoint using deprecated processor
sms-received.ts - Old direct processing pattern
email-received.ts - Old direct processing pattern
deduplication.ts - Only used by old system


Removed Redundant Processing:

process-webhooks.ts - Was causing double processing
trigger-cron.ts - Only existed to trigger the above
nativeWebhookProcessor.ts - Old monolithic processor


Fixed process-install-queue.ts:

Removed dependency on old processor
Now routes failed installs back through the new queue system



üèóÔ∏è Current Clean Architecture:
Webhook Entry ‚Üí native.ts ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Specialized Processors
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CriticalProcessor (INSTALL/UNINSTALL)
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MessagesProcessor
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactsProcessor  
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppointmentsProcessor
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectsProcessor
                                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FinancialProcessor
                                              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GeneralProcessor
üìÅ What We Kept (and why):

All processor classes - Working well
All specialized cron jobs - Each handles specific types
directProcessor.ts - Keeping for potential future use
installQueue.ts - Has lock cleanup logic for installs
Workflow webhooks - Separate system for custom workflows

üéØ Result:

No more deprecated code
No more double processing
Clear separation of concerns
Each webhook type has one clear processing path

The webhook system is now clean, modular, and maintainable!
