Perfect! So this is really about organization, documentation, and cleanup rather than fixing broken things. Let's create a streamlined plan focused on inventory and reorganization.
📋 LPai Backend Inventory & Reorganization Plan
🎯 Goals

Complete inventory of what exists
Identify deprecated/unused files for removal
Create clear documentation and system map
Reorganize for better developer experience
Establish patterns for future development

📊 Phase 1: Inventory & Mapping (No Code Changes)
Step 1: File Tree Analysis
bash# Get complete file structure
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" \) | grep -v node_modules | sort > backend-structure.txt

# Get file sizes to identify large files
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" \) -exec ls -lh {} \; | grep -v node_modules > file-sizes.txt

# Count lines of code by directory
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | grep -v node_modules | xargs wc -l | sort -n > line-counts.txt
Step 2: Quick Audit
You share:

File structure output
Brief note on any files you KNOW are deprecated
Any folders that are confusing/messy

## Active Endpoints
/api/contacts - Contact management
/api/projects - Project management
[... complete list]

## Deprecated Files (Can Delete)
/api/old-endpoint.ts - Replaced by new-endpoint
[... list]

## Unclear Purpose (Need Review)
/api/mystery-file.ts - [needs investigation]
[... list]
📁 Phase 2: Organization Plan
Current Structure Issues:

GHL push/pull operations mixed in same folders
Webhook processors scattered
No clear separation of concerns
Some duplicate functionality

Proposed Organization:
pages/api/
├── webhooks/          # All incoming webhooks
│   ├── ghl/          # GHL native webhooks  
│   └── workflow/     # Workflow webhooks
├── sync/             # Pull from external (GHL -> MongoDB)
│   └── ghl/         
├── push/             # Push to external (MongoDB -> GHL)
│   └── ghl/
├── resources/        # REST CRUD endpoints
│   ├── contacts/
│   ├── projects/
│   └── quotes/
├── cron/            # Scheduled jobs
├── auth/            # Authentication
└── internal/        # Internal tools/debug

src/
├── lib/             # Shared libraries
├── services/        # Business logic
├── types/           # TypeScript types
└── utils/           # Helper functions
📝 Phase 3: Documentation Creation
1. API Reference (Automated)
typescript// Create a script to auto-generate docs
// Reads all endpoints and creates markdown

## Endpoints

### POST /api/contacts
Description: Create a new contact
Pushes to: GHL
Stores in: MongoDB contacts collection
Required fields: firstName, lastName, email
2. System Flow Diagrams
mermaidgraph LR
    A[GHL Webhook] --> B[Native Webhook Handler]
    B --> C[Queue System]
    C --> D[Processor]
    D --> E[MongoDB]
    D --> F[Push to GHL if needed]
3. Developer Guide

How to add new endpoints
Where to put different types of code
Naming conventions
Common patterns

🧹 Phase 4: Cleanup Execution
Safe Cleanup Process:

Mark deprecated files (add .deprecated to filename)
Run for 1 week to ensure nothing breaks
Delete deprecated files
Move files to new structure (one category at a time)
Update imports
Test everything

markdown# Backend Organization Project

## Goal
Organize and document working backend (no bugs, just messy)

## Current State
- Everything works
- Some deprecated files
- Poor organization
- Need documentation

## Step 1 Results
[Paste file structure]

## Known Deprecated Files
- /api/old-thing.ts
- /api/unused-endpoint.ts

## Messy Areas
- /api/ghl/* folder has both push and pull
- Webhook handlers scattered
- [Other issues]

Please help me:
1. Create complete inventory
2. Identify what can be deleted
3. Suggest organization improvements
4. Create documentation
🎯 Quick Wins:

Delete obvious deprecated files
Group related endpoints
Add README files to each folder
Create one source of truth for API docs
Standardize file naming
