Data Hierarchy & Updates
1. Project = Master Timeline
The project should track ALL major milestones across its lifecycle:

Quote created
Quote signed
Deposit paid
Work started
Progress payments
Work completed
Final payment

2. Quote = Contract/Financial Record
The quote tracks its own specific status:

Draft → Published → Signed → Deposit_Paid → Paid

3. Best Update Strategy
When events happen, update BOTH:
javascript// When quote is signed
await db.collection('quotes').updateOne(
  { _id: quoteId },
  { $set: { status: 'signed' }, $push: { activityFeed: {...} } }
);

await db.collection('projects').updateOne(
  { _id: projectId },
  { 
    $set: { 
      status: 'won',
      contractSigned: true,
      contractSignedAt: new Date()
    },
    $push: { 
      timeline: {
        event: 'quote_signed',
        quoteId: quoteId,
        timestamp: new Date()
      }
    }
  }
);
For Your Filtering Needs:
Quote Builder Screen
Filter quotes by:

status: 'draft' - Working quotes
status: 'published' - Awaiting signature
status: 'signed' - Awaiting deposit
status: 'deposit_paid' - Active projects

Projects Screen
Filter projects by:

status: 'won' && depositPaid: false - Need deposit
status: 'won' && depositPaid: true - Ready to start
status: 'in_progress' - Active work
status: 'completed' - Finished

The Smart Approach:

Add to Project Schema:

javascript{
  // Financial tracking
  contractSigned: Boolean,
  contractSignedAt: Date,
  depositPaid: Boolean,
  depositPaidAt: Date,
  finalPaymentReceived: Boolean,
  
  // Status progression
  status: 'lead' | 'quoted' | 'won' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'closed'
}

Update Both Collections when key events happen
Query the appropriate collection based on the screen:

Quote Builder → Query quotes collection
Projects → Query projects collection

shit, don't write code til we confirm lol, so this is the quote builder screen. what your talking about is more for projects right? should we rewrite the flow of everything? Now we have all the tools so they can be accessed from everywhere. This is being built for in home service companies. So they will have appointments for typically in home service calls, some companies will have mostly projects that last 1-2 weeks. We could have multiple flows that they can pick from, i want this app to be fast and efficient though. I dont want it cluttered with info. can you help me brainstorm for best flow and if we should restructure? lol i know it's a bad time to do this once we have done all this work
